# üêç Snake Game

This repository contains an implementation of the classic Snake game developed in the C programming language.

## Description

Snake is a game where the player controls a snake moving around the screen. The objective is to collect as much food as possible (represented by a character on the screen) without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body. Each time the snake eats, it grows longer, increasing the game's difficulty.
